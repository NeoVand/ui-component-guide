## 📖 About
This project serves as a comprehensive guide to various UI component libraries. Its primary goal is to help developers—especially those using AI coding assistants—quickly identify, understand, and implement components without digging through fragmented documentation.

### Key Features
*   **Visual Registry**: Browse components from multiple libraries in one place.
*   **AI-Ready Prompts**: Get the exact names and copy-pasteable prompts to ask your AI assistant to generate these components.
*   **Interactive Tuner**: Customize component props (color, size, variant) in real-time and see the generated code update instantly.
*   **Theme Awareness**: See how components adapt to light and dark modes and different color palettes.
